# Decision-Making Framework
# Description
Welcome to our project!
This is a decision making framework made in React and JavaScript. This software allows users to quickly and easily choose the most appropriate voting method.
The application will assist charities in making decisions that will help their organizations. This application will also help other donors to make more informed decisions about how to help these organizations. This software will make it easier for charities to choose the best courses for their future and will give donors the information they need to make informed decisions."
