						Would it be better to do a first pass at the decision with a simple
						voting method (e.g., yes/no to each option) and then do a second
						pass with a more complex voting method (e.g., scale of 1-5 for each
						option)?
					</li>
					<li>
						Would it be good for decision-makers to share their views before
						making a final decision?
					</li>
					<li>
						Is this an ongoing decision that needs to be updated on a regular
						schedule?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you answered YES to any of these questions, consider categorized it
					as iterative.
